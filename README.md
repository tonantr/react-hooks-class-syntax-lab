# Class Syntax Lab

## Learning Goals

- Refactor function components to class components

## Instructions

In this lab is the working code from a previous lab, using function components.
If you run the tests now, they should all pass, except for the tests checking
that you are using class components instead of functions.

Your goal is to refactor all the components in the `src/components` directory to
use classes instead of functions, and _still_ have the tests passing.

Good luck!!!
